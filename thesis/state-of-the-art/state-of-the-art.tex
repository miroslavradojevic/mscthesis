\chapter{State of the art} \label{chap:state-of-the-art}

This chapter gives an overview of the methods and existing algorithms for underwater vehicle localization. In existing survey on underwater vehicle navigation, Kingsey et al. \cite{kinsey06} already give a summary presenting some methods used. As stated in \cite{kinsey06}, localization is influenced with the development sensor devices. Chapter \S~\ref{chap:sensors} gives more insight into performance of each sensor device used for
