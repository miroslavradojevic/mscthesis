\chapter{State of the art} \label{chap:state-of-the-art}
Mention the PhD thesis \cite{ribas10}.
%%%%Localization exploring map or scan matching techniques was presented in \cite{Cox91} and \cite{Lu97}. 
%%%%Approach that uses geometrical landmarks in Kalman filters is explained in \cite{Leonard91}. These led to SLAM.
%%%%One work from HW is \cite{Ruiz01}.

%Author reminds that the vehicle position estimate can exceed the errors related to the acoustic range sensor \cite{roman05}. Such difference can cause errors or inconsistencies . Solution for this problem, as reported in \cite{roman05} means regisration of the ``sub-maps''.
