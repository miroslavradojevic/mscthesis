This chapter gives an overview of the sensors used in localization of a Nessie underwater vehicle. Localization of a vehicle 

Systems and sensros of the underwater vehicle

\section{Inertial navigation system}
Provides position, linear velocities, orientation and angular velocitioes. Accelerations are not used. 
\section{Acoustic system}
Provides the position
\section{Bathymetry system}
Accomplishes depth measurement. It is possible to use acoustic system for this purpose, however, bathymeter using pressure information tends to be more precise and trustable.
