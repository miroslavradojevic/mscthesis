In terms of accuracy, Distribution of Gaussian random variable that undergoes nonlinear transformation is approximated using first order linearisation (within EKF algorithm). In search for better accuracy Gaussian random variable was treated with Unscented Transform (UT) as an attempt to provide better precision and more robustness. However, variations and ideas on Unscented Kalman Filtering approach, particularly UT exist \cite{julier02,van01} that could be tested on this particular application for better performance, especially when treating LBL updates since selected LBL position information location contains randomness, discontinuities in distribution???
