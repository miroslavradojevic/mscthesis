\section{Simulations} \label{sec:sim}
Real data taken from previously recorded Nessie mission were used to simulate the algorithm ``offline''. It is the stage intended for testing and correcting. Besides, simulating - being able to repeat the same measurement scenario enables more insight in filtering process and benefits of fusing together the sensor data. \textit{.bag} files (\url{http://www.ros.org/wiki/}) containing recorded real-time messages with sensor measurements, were used as source. Furthermore, it allows designing the code in its original C++ form that will require little modification once deployed on the vehicle in form of ROS package since \textit{.bag} files emulate authentic messages and timestamps. One of the deficiencies of the evaluation of localisation results is the fact that there is no exact ground truth to compare the result with. Dead reckoning localisation aided with occasional LBL position updates was compared with the localisation obtained after filtering (Figures ~\ref{fig:auv-sim-straight2}, ~\ref{fig:auv-sim-straight1}) for the recorded straight line mission. 

\T{Loch Earn dataset - straight line movement}: Example of EKF localisation using inertial measurements aided with LBL acoustic positioning system was tested on straight line movement recorded in lake Loch Earn. For simulation purposes, sensor measurements are stored in a \textit{.bag} file, that can be replayed, producing real-time messages of sensor measurements as they originally occurred. At this point, it is important to revise which sensors were used, their main features and, finally, filtering parameters. 

Standard sensor configuration comprising of pressure sensor, magnetic compass, FOG and DVL is used in the mission. Absolute position correction was carried out using LBL system. Important fact is that the heading was measured with compass only at the beginning. It kept being calculated by integrating yaw rate obtained from FOG, later on. Alternative solution for heading measurement is the usage of compass for direct acquiring of yaw. Result of EKF localisation algorithm was shown in north-east map (Figure ~\ref{fig:sim-straight2}, ~\ref{fig:sim-straight1}). Different parameter values for EKF were tested. Table ~\ref{tab:ekf-params} revises all filter parameters used together with their role. Essentially, setting high standard deviation for a Gaussian of a certain parameter can be interpreted as having more uncertainty in value that it represents - whether it is a measurement uncertainty or uncertainty of the predicted value. Therefore, we can choose to be confident in certain sensor measurement and/or certain model prediction, and observe the simulation outcome of such setting. Setting the parameters properly tunes up the performance of a filter.

Straight line movement with authentic sensor measurements recorded in Loch Earn was a basis for initial simulations of EKF localisation algorithm. Red line shows the dead reckoning navigation, which is updated with absolute position update (LBL). Dead reckoning uses values periodically ($\approx$5$Hz$) obtained from DVL and FOG (linear velocities: $u$ and $v$ and heading $\psi$, respectfully), and substitutes them into equations similar to ones used for north and east prediction within prediction model: 
$$ north = north + (uT+\dot{u}\frac{T^{2}}{2})\cos(\psi) - (vT+\dot{v}\frac{T^{2}}{2})\sin(\psi) $$
$$ east  = east  + (uT+\dot{u}\frac{T^{2}}{2})\sin(\psi) + (vT+\dot{v}\frac{T^{2}}{2})\cos(\psi) $$

EKF updates periodically (synchronous mode), with period set to 230 ms. At first, simulation parameters SDnorth, SDeast, SDyaw, SDyawRate were set to low values. Generally, that suggests high trust in measurements. Result (Figure ~\ref{fig:sim-straight2}) shows that the heading measurement has a constant bias, caused by the error in initial heading measurement obtained by compass. After obtaining initial heading, yaw rate was integrated in time to calculate yaw. Thus, yaw measurement, calculated relative to previous value each time, propagates the error (bias). Biased yaw observation further on causes EKF localisation to experience sharp jumps. To overcome this using EKF framework, less confidence was assigned to yaw measurement (SDyaw) when setting EKF parameter values. Eventually, bias becomes visible if measured and filtered heading are compared (Figure ~\ref{fig:yaw-straight1}). As for the rest of heading information, rate of yaw information will be incorporated when using EKF, this time with a lot of confidence (SDyawRate range of degrees) since it does not depend on initial estimate. Good feature of sensor fusion is that lack of one measurement or its low performance can be compensated with some other measurement considering that they are combined together in mathematical model in the right manner. In case of yaw and yaw rate - the derivation in time is a relation that connects them together. 

Simulation shows that localisation performance can be tailored by setting the confidence in prediction model or measurement values. Confidence is manifested as standard deviation (variance) of the random variable: the lower it is, more certain the value of the random variable is hence more confident in value of that variable we tend to be. Kalman filter tries to optimise the result within the defined boundaries of uncertainty.
