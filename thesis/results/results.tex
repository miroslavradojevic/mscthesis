\chapter{Results} \label{chap:results}
Main purpose of the thesis is the implementation of a navigation system that uses measurements from different sensors, fuses the sensory data together in order to make presumably better quality estimate of the position and the orientation of the underwater robot. Existing data from the real missions were used to carry out the initial trials. It is useful to mention that there is no exact ground truth for underwater robot localization available. GPS signal, if available, could serve as an absolute position reference: either directly or in form of LBL. Experimental results have been obtained for different missions. Good news, however, is that the absolute depth measurement is quite accurate and frequent, making AUV localisation a 2D task.

\T{Sensor fusion for heading: } being in search for heading measurement less prone to initial error, and guided by simulation results, real scenarios were accomplished using magnetic compass for heading measurement. Compass is more sensitive to magnetic disturbances (Figure ~\ref{fig:magnetic-disturb}), slower than FOG but, importantly, gives an absolute measure. Therefore, it does not rely on previous measurements. An experiment was made by just manually rotating the robot horizontally while keeping the same position - changing its heading. Figures ~\ref{fig:lostFog} and ~\ref{fig:lostCompass} show the performance of yaw filtering using EKF and the example of sensor fusion of compass and FOG. Namely, compass (Figure ~\ref{fig:lostCompass}) or FOG (Figure ~\ref{fig:lostFog}) were disabled at one point during the experiment. When one of them stops working, the other one tries to compensate the failure.

\T{Trajectory filtering: } Spiral trajectory and surfacing action was taken with Nessie starting from the depth of around 12 m. EKF filtering results are shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:spiral} together with LBL position updates and dead reckoning starting from each position. Similarly as with previous plots, dead reckoning was shown together with LBL position updates. Filtered trajectory does not experience severe jumps, and the curve seems to be smoother and less prone to drifting. Standard deviation of north and east measurement parameter (Table ~\ref{tab:ekf-params}) was tested with different values, causing more or less confidence in LBL measurement hence shaping the filtered localisation curve. Presented LBL measurements are exhibiting quite diverse range of values.

Causes of position correction errors are numerous: from ``multipathing'' outliers (Figure ~\ref{fig:multipathing}) till the imprecision inferred from the nature of volatile acoustic and GPS information. ``Multipathing'' causes outliers in position information as a result of false reflections for instance. Acoustic and GPS imprecision can be treated as Gaussian random variable.

It is likely that some of the LBL position updates deviate from the trajectory. Hence, a mechanism for rejecting the outliers was investigated. EKF was tested on raw LBL position updates. Intention is to manage the filtration of the ``outliers'' by using properly tuned EKF. Motivation to explore such possibility comes from two scenarios encountered in earlier missions. In such missions position wad dead reckoned and LBL was used to assign each time a new value of north and east coordinate. LBL outliers were ruled out using a median filter applied on the last eleven position coordinates once the latest LBL exceeded the set threshold in position change. The missions showcased situations when: 
\begin{itemize}
\item LBL rejection is carried out despite being a ``false alarm'' - Figure ~\ref{fig:straight-median-ekf},
\item rejection of the LBL is the right choice - Figure ~\ref{fig:spiral-median-ekf}
\end{itemize}
It is important to say that LBL position filtering was implemented in form of median filter. EKF was updated with raw LBL data instead of median filter. Rejecting an LBL measurement can turn out to be right (Figure ~\ref{fig:spiral-median-ekf}) as well as a wrong decision (Figure ~\ref{fig:straight-median-ekf}). That is why EKF was suggested as an alternative. Examples of EKF's performance are shown in both Figures ~\ref{fig:straight-median-ekf} and ~\ref{fig:spiral-median-ekf}. Solution is not as categoric as median filter. Moreover, it is more robust. By giving certain trust in LBL observation it always takes it into account. Median filter, on the other hand, can be too selective in being right or wrong. If it turns out that LBL positions do follow each other, EKF continues slowly following that direction. If the outliers are isolated, EKF successfully rules them out (Figure ~\ref{fig:spiral-median-ekf}).

\T{Square trajectories: } square trajectories were tested in low depths of a lake, with the GPS signal available to be used as a position reference and ground truth indication (Figures ~\ref{fig:no-gps}, ~\ref{fig:with-gps}). Dead reckoning navigation was used as a reference when controlling the vehicle movement during the experiment. This fact can cause slight confusion in analysis of the trajectory graphs since all the dynamics and forces were applied with respect to the dead reckoning navigation which is an estimated value, not the real existing one. It is a slightly inverse logic of testing, nevertheless further tests are yet to be accomplished. Emphasis of this experiment was to show that EKF can work successfully and analyse the main characteristics of the navigation design. It is likely that the GPS emulated square-shaped trajectories float as the elapsed path becomes longer. GPS signal available from the antenna located on the water surface is serving as a measure of absolute position within the lake - giving an idea about the actual vehicle position while it tries to moves within the boundaries of estimated dead reckoning position. 

Main issue when performing the square trajectory tests was significant imprecision of GPS signal. Many reasons can possibly influence the imprecision: from the weather conditions till surrounding objects. Basically anything that can affect the satellite visibility and the quality of the signal. Drifting can reach up to several meters which is unacceptable considering the trajectory length. Finally, the trajectory of the experiment itself is quite short ($ \approx 10 m $) to be seriously and accurately covered with precise GPS position update. Figure ~\ref{fig:gps} shows the tested trajectory and depicts the encountered amount of GPS imprecision.

\T{Without GPS: } EKF localisation was tested in given conditions. Initially, only motion (inertial) sensors were used within the observations. That implies all the available linear and angular velocity sensors. Absolute position (raw GPS signal in this constellation) was not included in observations. EKF periodically updates (synchronous mode, \S~\ref{chap:methodology}), with the rate of 10 Hz. The aim was to measure the performance and the amount of drifting that occurs since the robot is intended to repeatedly attain square-like paths and return to the starting position in ideal scenario. It is useful to mention that proper parameter tuning can significantly change filtering performance. By giving more or less trust in particular measurement, or particular model behaviour, the role of certain parameters of dynamics (velocities, angular velocities) can be emphasized if necessary. Figure ~\ref{fig:no-gps} shows the performance of EKF without GPS position correction after one trajectory cycle, and the original path that was followed, recorded using GPS. Initial position was taken from the first GPS measurement and the first measurement can indeed be away from the real position due to GPS imprecision. Note that the control of the vehicle trajectory refers to dead-reckoning calculated north-east values, not some physical beacons with known position. At the time of reporting the experiments, testing were not fully completed with all the planned scenario variations. Localisation expectedly tends to perform with a significant drift without the absolute position update (Figure ~\ref{fig:square-1-noGps}). After the second square-shaped cycle (Figure ~\ref{fig:square-2-noGps}), EKF shows that it roughly tracks the shape of the trajectory, smooths it by filtering out the measurement outliers. Vehicle has returned approximately to the same position after each cycle. Drift gained when following one of the sides of the rectangular path was compensated with the same amount of drift but of the opposite sign that was active when taking the return direction. Enormous amount of drift is present since the information on absolute position is not considered. The first available GPS coordinate fixes the starting position and part of the initial position error is caused by being incapable of setting the initial position accurately.

\T{With GPS: } Finally, GPS measurements were appended to the EKF observations. Localisation results were shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:with-gps} for two different level of confidence (variances) in position measurement. Naturally, giving extremely high confidence does not seem to be the best choice, however, some empirically deduced values in range of decimetres significantly correct the dead reckoning drift. Furthermore, EKF tends to filter the GPS measured north east coordinates, hence partially corrects the GPS imprecisions stated at the beginning. At this point it is evident why EKF is a great tool. Filter tries to satisfy the set uncertainty boundaries and fuse all the available information trying to make the most out of it combined together in one mathematical system. Moreover, fusing such imprecise and sketchy position data from GPS, still improves the localisation. Obtained trajectory tends to go towards what can be treated as expected path. From something that looked like a noisy collection of position observations at the beginning (Figure ~\ref{fig:gps-signal}), application of EKF together with sensor fusion enabled having generally better performance in navigation.     
%Combination of all relevant sensors gives in a Kalman filter state estimate results in more precise position and heading compared with instant (flat) usage of position and orientation measurements.
