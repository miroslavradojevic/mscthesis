\chapter{Navigation capabilities of AUVs} \label{chap:capabilities}
This chapter gives an overview of main elements of navigation of an underwater vehicle, methods and existing algorithms for underwater vehicle localization. Ideas and concepts implemented to utilize the sensor measurements. Section \S~\ref{sec:lit-review}  gives an overview of the literature and related work that reporting various AUV navigation methods. 

Managing underwater vehicle localization means using concepts such as vehicle state or navigation strategy .It is possible refer to those different concepts when making a classification of navigation solutions. In addition, we could treat localization as absolute or relative, depending on which reference system we use when obtaining measurements. Absolute localization takes environment point as reference system while relative consider the vehicle itself to be the reference.
\section{State estimation}
Vehicle navigation state describes its position within the environment. It is a vector that contains variables relevant for localizing the vehicle. State interpretation would categorize navigation methods on those that treat state as stochastic: linear or nonlinear, or deterministic \cite{kinsey06}. Thus, navigation state estimators can be based on stochastic state estimators or deterministic state observers \cite{kinsey06}.

\section{Stochastic state estimators}
The name of such methods suggests that states are treated as ultimately having feature of randomness built-in - means being or having a random variable. That does not seem as a wrong conclusion after recognizing that state of a system, is seldom known precisely. It is the essential nature of the process or the instrument used for measuring or the estimation algorithm itself that fails at submitting utterly accurate data all the time. We could say that many phenomena are random till certain extent. Statistically speaking, estimation is a rule used to calculate an estimate of a variable of interest using the observed data. As it is the case with random variables, we can say that certain state has an expected value, and that such ``randomness'' can be expressed with the distribution formula, resulting in values such as mean and standard deviation that fully describe the distribution in concrete case of gaussian, for instance. This approach has been appied often in underwater navigation. Most notable stachastic state estimator is Kalman filter. Kalman filter is an unbiased, optimal estimator that in majority of the localization examples utilizes the kinematic model for making a prediction and, in general, describes how the system states change. Kalman filter and the EKF treat random variable as it has gaussian distribution which introduces some special features. Chapter \S~ref{chap:kalman} focuses more on Kalman filtering. In case of an underwater vehicle localization is accomplished using unbiased estimation such as Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and number of works report on usage of different variations of Kalman filters for state estimation. Following paragraphs make an overview of various stochastic estimator usage with the objective of determining (estimating) values that represent system state - location of the robot in the environment. 
	\subsection{Linear stochastic state estimators}
	\subsection{Nonlinear stochastic state estimators}
The issue of linearising or nonlinearising of the plant and observation models within Kalman filters was introduced in chapter on filtering, \S~ref{chap:kalman}. Various works report the usage of nonlinear estimators such as Unscented Kalman Filters (UKF). Methods that are based on random sampling (``Monte Carlo methods''), for instance Particle Filters (PF), are also used for localization, which brings us back to the concept of stochastic value, but from different perspective this time.

\section{Strategy} 
Finding a way to filter the state vector - stochastic or deterministic, linear or nonlinear, can employ different approaches. In that sense, we could talk about the strategy - the algorithm, the idea. The primary navigation system in most of the applications, including underwater navigation, is INS. Since such system introduces drift errors, ways of correcting those errors were developed. Most widely known ``correction tool'' is the incorporation of the GPS measurement. Numerous literature that considers integrating occasional GPS measurement within the stochastic state estimation algorithm is presented in Section ~\ref{sec:lit-review}. Oceanographic community typically uses three different strategies to handle the navigation underwater \cite{whitcomb99}. Of course, they can be combined together, depending on purpose or conditions: (1) transponder networks on the seafloor (long baseline, LBL), (2) ship-AUV communication (short baseline), and (3) sensors mounted on the underwater vehicle that measure range and inertial motion. Each of the strategies is different in terms of accuracy, costs and complexity \cite{eustice05}. Section \S~\ref{sec:sensors} gives more insight into performance and categorization of each sensor device used for underwater vehicle navigation. Naturally, most of the methods rely on acoustic waves used for measuring the distance. Navigation can be combined with simultaneous localization and mapping approach (SLAM), or can be terrain aided (Section ) \cite{kinsey06}. Although not common for most of the vehicles, visual information recorded by a camera or a pair of cameras can be used to aid navigation (reduce the drift) \cite{eustice05large, bahr08}. On top of already mentioned methods, some novel strategies where vehicles communicate among themselves, such as cooperation for navigation (Section ), are explored \cite{bahr08}.  
%in order to overcome the shortcomings of conventional navigation approach. 
This chapter gives an overview of the .       

\section{Acoustic-based localization techniques} \label{sec:acoustic}
In the absence of possibility to transmit radio waves, acoustic communication emerges as solution for communication underwater.
Underwater acoustic positioning system is the main tool used to track underwater vehicles. Reason for relying on acoustics is the nature of the water environment - resistant to radio waves, leaving out mechanical acoustic disturbance as the only mean of communication. Three classes of underwater acoustic positioning systems are used: Long Baseline (LBL), Ultra Short Baseline Systems (USBL), Short Baseline Systems (SBL) and GPS intelligent buoys (GIB). 

LBL systems (figure ~\ref{fig:standard-lbl}) use a network of two or more sea-floor mounted (anchored) baseline transponders to reference the navigation. Such system is considered to be accurate, generally with accuracy better that 1 meter - usually around few centimetres \cite{noaa01}. However, communication-wise, such system is convenient for small number of vehicles, since one vehicle can query the network each time \cite{bahr08}, hence having a large number of vehicles can cause update delays. Elapsed time between moment of sending the query and receiving the response is used to estimate the time-of-flight ($t_{flight}$) of the wave and eventually the distance ($d$) between beacon and the vehicle, considering that the speed of the sound ($c$) is known and the essential relation $c = \frac{d}{t_{flight}}$ is used for calculation. By using methods such as triangulation, these distances can be used to compute the AUV's absolute position. LBL systems can be long-range or short-range. Long-range systems use 12 kHz frequencies for communication range of 10 km of distance with the error varying from 1 up to 10 m \cite{whitcomb99combined}, \cite{bahr08}. Short-range systems use 300 kHz frequencies and operate within the range of 100 m with sub-centimetre precision \cite{whitcomb99combined}, \cite{bahr08}. 
 
SBL systems (figure ~\ref{fig:short-lbl}) do not require sea-floor mounted transponders. Instead SBL system uses a vessel equipped with high-frequency directional emitter in order to accurately determine the AUV position with respect to the vessel \cite{maurelli08}. Disadvantage of such system is the need for providing a vessel and the distance limits since the range between the ship and the AUV has to be short. Moreover, SBL accuracy improves with transducer spacing (possibility of longer baseline). Similarly, the range measurements are used to triangulate the position. Transducer sends a signal, transponder located on the vehicle responds yielding distance information. AUV's location is determined with respect to transducers' location.

USBL systems (figure ~\ref{fig:ultra-short-lbl}) uses similar beacons as LBL system. Difference is that vehicle has transceiver with several receiving elements positioned close to each other on a known distance so that the reply from beacons is detected by all of them. It is possible to calculate the phase difference between received signals this way which is enough to determine the bearing to the beacon. If the distance information is combined together with bearing, then the absolute position of the vehicle can be estimated just by considering the response of only one beacon. 

GIB systems (figure ~\ref{fig:gib-lbl}) consist of floating buoys supplied by GPS signal carrying transducers. Vehicle has transponder that replies to transducer query with acoustic signal, enabling buoys to register the time-of-flight. Such concept is inverted from the one accomplished in standard LBL.

Common feature for all the systems is that vehicle position is defined with acoustic feedback from transponders so that the vehicle is capable of locating itself with respect to transponders.

\section{Terrain-aided navigation} 
Terrain-aided navigation can be used to determine the vehicle position using topographic, magnetic or gravitational data \cite{kinsey06}. Terrain-aided navigation can rely on the map of the sea bottom, its elevation or some particular landmarks that are detected to fix the vehicle position. In such circumstances, it is possible to define the map first and try to navigate with respect to that map (map known a-priori) or manage the mapping and navigation simultaneously using sensor data to build the map from the scratch, step by step. Disadvantage of terrain based methods lies in fact that they depend on precision of the map of the floor and ability of the vehicle to sense the depth or image the sea floor. In most of navigation scenarios, a-priori maps are not available.
The essential sensor for terrain aided navigation is sonar that measures the distance. However it is possible to use optical sensor devices and process the visual information. Range of optical sensors is much shorter, and the optical information cannot spread as freely and as far as the acoustic information does. However, its nature of information is different.
