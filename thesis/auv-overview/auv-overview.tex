\chapter{Navigation capabilities of AUVs} \label{chap:capabilities}
This chapter gives an overview of the main navigation elements for an underwater vehicle. Methods and existing algorithms for underwater vehicle localisation have been summarized. Section \S~\ref{sec:lit-review}  gives an overview of the literature and related work reporting various AUV navigation methods. 

Carrying out underwater vehicle localisation implies using concepts such as \textit{vehicle state} within the \textit{navigation strategy} framework. Those two concepts will serve as a starting point for reviewing different methods. It is possible to refer to the definition of the vehicle state and its features when categorizing navigation solutions. On the other hand, navigation solutions can be essentially based on different ideas (strategies). In addition, we could treat any kind of localisation as absolute or relative, depending on which reference system we use when obtaining measurements. Absolute localisation takes environment point as reference system while relative considers the vehicle itself to be the reference. Most of the techniques surveyed here deal with absolute localisation. 
\section{State estimation}
Vehicle navigation state describes its position within the environment. The state is a vector that contains variables relevant for localizing the vehicle. State interpretation would further categorize navigation methods on those that treat state as stochastic: linear or nonlinear, or deterministic \cite{kinsey06}. Thus, navigation state estimators can be based on stochastic state estimators or deterministic state observers \cite{kinsey06}.

%For an underwater vehicle, localization is accomplished using unbiased estimation such as Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). 
\section{Stochastic state estimators}
The name of stochastic state estimation methods suggests that states are treated as ultimately having feature of randomness built-in. That means being or having a random variable, or grouping random values in certain manner. It does not seem to be a wrong conclusion after recognizing that state of a system, is seldom known precisely. It is the essential nature of the process or the instrument used for measuring or the estimation algorithm itself that it fails at submitting utterly accurate data all the time. We could say that many natural phenomena are random with certain distribution of the randomness. Random variable distributions are conveniently treated as Gaussians. Statistically speaking, estimation is a rule used to calculate an estimate of a variable of interest using the observed data. As it is the case with random variables, we can say that certain state has an expected value, and that such ``randomness'' can be expressed with the distribution formula, resulting in descriptor values such as mean and standard deviation that fully describe the distribution in particular case of Gaussian, for instance. This approach has been applied often in underwater navigation. Most notable stochastic state estimator is Kalman filter (Section \S~\ref{sec:kf}). Kalman filter is an unbiased, optimal estimator \cite{kalman60, grewal01}. KF works through iterations by employing the process model for making the state prediction and the observations for doing the state correction (Figure ~\ref{fig:diagram-kalman}). Kalman filter and the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) treat random variable as having a Gaussian distribution. Sections \S~\ref{sec:kf} and \S~\ref{sec:ekf} provide more details on Kalman filtering. A number of works report on usage of different variations of Kalman filters for state estimation. %Following paragraphs make an overview of various stochastic estimator usage with the objective of determining (estimating) values that represent system state - location of the robot in the environment. Methods considered for this review exploit different sensor types.
%However, it is not the only component. 
\subsection{Linear stochastic state estimators}
Localisation of a robot naturally requires sensor measurements. Methodologies that work with state estimation employ measurements in terms of adding them as supplementary information to the mathematical model of object movement. Linear kinematic models are not suitable for describing the dynamics of the vehicle, therefore most of the solutions implement nonlinear stochastic state estimation.   
%within Kalman filters was introduced in chapter on filtering, \S~\ref{chap:kalman}
%where the whole procedure involves
\subsection{Nonlinear stochastic state estimators}
The necessity of linearising the plant and observation models to comply with linear Kalman Filter is the basis of EKF derivation. Various works report the usage of other interesting nonlinear estimators such as Unscented Kalman Filters (UKF). Methods that are based on random sampling (``Monte Carlo methods''), for instance Particle Filters (PF), are also used for localization underwater, which brings us back to the concept of stochastic value, but from the perspective of sampling those stochastic values. The work presented in the thesis focuses on nonlinear stochastic state estimators such as EKF and UKF.
%\section{Nonlinear filtering} 
%(such as defining underwater vehicle location) 
\T{Nonlinearity } is a common phenomenon. Real world consists of various nonlinear systems. Practical situations often demand the usage of approximations that eventually lead to linearisation. The solution obtained this way is claimed to be sub-optimal - not perfectly tuned, but, indeed, useful. The problem is to consecutively make an estimation of the state of a dynamic system using a sequence of noisy measurements \cite{ristic04}. State-space approach turns out to be suitable choice when dealing with nonlinearity and estimating (filtering) values of the group of variables. Number of filters have been designed to deal with the phenomenon. Depending on the methodology, they could be roughly categorized as \cite{ristic04}: 
\begin{itemize}
\item those that use analytic approximations (e.g. EKF)
\item those that use numerical approximations
\item those that use multiple models
\item those that use sampling (e.g. UKF)
\end{itemize} 
Since approximations eventually lead to linearising the system, a short overview of linear Kalman Filter (KF) is given in order to make an introduction on something that will be the basis for methods presented.
\section{Kalman Filter (KF)} \label{sec:kf} 
KF \cite{kalman60}  is a well known mathematical tool that offers solution to \textit{linear-quadratic problem} in form of an estimator \cite{grewal01,ristic04}. Such linear estimator is optimal in terms of any quadratic function of the estimation error \cite{grewal01}. It is based on an iterative and recursive process. In addition, it is well suited framework for blending together different sensor measurements. Mathematically speaking - world consists of variety of systems that change their state $(\vect{x}(k))$ in time. Guided by this foundation, science has established a concept of \textit{linear dynamic system model} (Table ~\ref{tab:system}) consisted of \textit{process model} and \textit{measurement model}. \textit{Process model} (Table ~\ref{tab:system}) is perturbed by Gaussian white noise $(\vect{n})$. It emulates the behaviour of a phenomenon (change of the states) together with its hereditary randomness. \textit{Measurement model} (Table ~\ref{tab:system}) emulates observations of the system state. Observations are expressed as linear functions of state variables corrupted with Gaussian white measurement noise $(\vect{m})$, similarly as the process model itself. System can receive control inputs $(\vect{u}(k))$. Covariances of the process $(\vect{n})$ and measurement $(\vect{m})$ noise, are $\vect{Q}$ and $\vect{R}$ respectfully. Covariances are important components of filtering algorithm ~\ref{alg:kf}. They can be interpreted as uncertainties in particular prediction or measurement.

The Discrete Kalman Filter is an optimal unbiased minimum mean squared error estimator. It is a calculation process that works recursively, passing iterations as shown in diagram ~\ref{fig:diagram-kalman}. Kalman filter uses three basic steps: prediction, measurement and update. One iteration uses process equation, next one proceeds further using prediction result within the observation equation. Recursion continues each time referring to previous filter output.

Assumptions that KF uses:
\begin{itemize}
\item distribution of a random variable is assumed to be Gaussian, therefore mean and variance can fully describe it
\item linear transform of a Gaussian distribution gives another Gaussian distribution 
\end{itemize}
In spirit of that, noise vectors ($\vect{n}, \vect{m}$)  and thus linearly derived state and observation vectors ($\vect{x}, \vect{z}$) are Gaussian. Another assumption is that noise vectors $n$, $m$ have zero mean values (``white Gaussian'') and that their elements are not correlated, resulting in diagonal matrices $\vect{Q}$ and $\vect{R}$ (Table ~\ref{tab:system}).

KF can be summarized with the set of formulas given in Algorithm ~\ref{alg:kf}. The aim of the equations is to recursively obtain the estimate of the state vector ${\vect{\hat{x}}}$ and the uncertainty of such estimate. Uncertainty is described as state variance $\vect{P}(k) = E\lbrace (\vect{x}(k) - \vect{\hat{x}}(k)) (\vect{x}(k) - \vect{\hat{x}}(k))^{T} \rbrace$. KF defines states as collection of elements with Gaussian distribution, thus mean value is used as an estimate and variance as a measure of how far the values are spread out around mean. Notation follows the one from the Table ~\ref{tab:system}. $\vect{\hat{x}}(k \mid l)$ is a state estimate at the time $k$ using observations obtained until time moment $m$. It is a recursive estimator since every estimation relies on previous state estimation and current observation (measurement). Although history of previous observations is not directly used, it is still incorporated in previous state estimation. Previous state estimation is used in current state estimate due to recursive nature of the algorithm. Transformation uncertainty $\vect{Q}$ is updated simultaneously with the state. Innovation $\nu$ presents difference between the real observation and predicted observation. Both innovation and its covariance matrix $\vect{S}$ are included in calculation of Kalman gain $K$. Kalman gain does the final state estimate correction ~\ref{alg:kf} influenced by recent observation and makes the uncertainty optimal with respect to quadratic estimation error criteria.

Although essentially intended for dealing with linear system, KF formulas are be important starting point in understanding nonlinear filtering accomplished with Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) or Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF).

\section{Deterministic state estimators}
Deterministic state estimators refer to non-stochastic system (plant, process) and observation (measurement) model. Stochastic means that the input and output can manifest in some random behaviour. Concept of deterministic state does not imply any uncertainty. However the estimation, apart from being precise and accurate, can be characterized with its stability. Estimation is exact (no randomisation of the variables) and estimator should be asymptotically stable \cite{kinsey07}. Stability is defined using different mathematical criteria \cite{kinsey07}. In this case, navigation elements such as speed or position or even full-state vector are an output of some defined transfer function. In order to know the transfer function, an estimator of the nonlinear transfer function model is used. Such approach utilizes the exact knowledge of nonlinear dynamics of the vehicle. Essentially, estimating deterministic state implies passing the input data through a certain transfer function so that the outputs are localisation related values. Transfer function is defined using known formulas of the transfer function and parameters which are estimated by giving particular input and observing the corresponding output of the system in order to recognize its behaviour. Being a completely different concept, in terms of methodology  they are not the focus of the thesis.
%Deterministic state estimators have not been extensively used in AUV localisation.
\section{Strategy} 
Now that the state vector is revealed as a storage for describing the vehicle location, finding a way to filter that state vector - stochastic or deterministic, linear or nonlinear, can employ different approaches. At this level, we can talk about the strategy - general approach, an idea. The primary navigation system in most of the applications, including underwater navigation, is Inertial Navigation System (INS) (Section \S~\ref{sec:ins}). Since such system accumulates noisy data, it introduces the drift errors that need to be occasionally corrected inside the navigation algorithm. Various ways of correcting those errors were developed. Most widely known ``correction tool'' is the incorporation of an absolute position measurement. Numerous literature that considers integrating occasional GPS or LBL measurement within the stochastic state estimation algorithm is presented in Section ~\ref{sec:lit-review}. 
%It usually manifests as some form of the GPS information adopted to be used underwater.
Oceanographic community typically uses three different strategies to handle the absolute positioning underwater \cite{whitcomb99}: (1) transponder networks on the seafloor (long baseline, LBL), (2) ship-AUV communication (short baseline), and (3) sensors mounted on the underwater vehicle that measure range and inertial motion. They can be combined together depending on the idea, purpose or conditions. Each of the strategies is different in terms of accuracy, costs, complexity \cite{eustice05} or types of sensors used. Section \S~\ref{chap:sensors} gives more insight into performance and categorization of each inertial sensor device used for underwater vehicle navigation. Naturally, most of the conventional methods rely on acoustic waves used for measuring the distance. Nevertheless, visual information is used, especially in transparent or structured environment \cite{carreras03}. Navigation can be combined with simultaneous localization and mapping approach (SLAM, Section \S~\ref{sec:slam}), or can be terrain aided (Section \S~\ref{sec:terrain-aided}) \cite{kinsey06}. Although not common for many applications, visual information recorded by the camera or a pair of cameras can be used to aid navigation (reduce the drift) \cite{eustice05large, bahr08}. If the localization involves control of the vehicle movement coupled with localisation and environment information, then it is addressed as active localisation. On top of already mentioned methods, some novel strategies in which vehicles communicate among themselves, such as cooperation for navigation (Section \S~\ref{sec:cooperation}), are explored \cite{bahr08}. Following chapter gives an overview of the mentioned strategies.       

\section{Acoustic-based localization techniques} \label{sec:acoustic}
In the absence of possibility to transmit radio waves, acoustic communication emerges as solution for communication underwater. Considering that the electromagnetic waves are absorbed and the propagation of light is limited, positioning cannot rely on GPS signal, laser scanners, visually aided navigation, or radio communication. Therefore, state of the art in absolute positioning of the robot underwater implies triangulation using distances from navigation buoys positioned at the known locations (Figure ~\ref{fig:gib-lbl}). Alternative solution is to surface back in order to update the position using GPS. 
 
Underwater acoustic positioning system is the main tool used to track underwater vehicles. Reason for relying on acoustics is the nature of the water environment:resistant to radio waves, leaving out mechanical acoustic disturbance as the only mean of communication. Three classes of underwater acoustic positioning systems are used (Figure ~\ref{fig:lbl}): Long Baseline (LBL), Ultra Short Baseline Systems (USBL), Short Baseline Systems (SBL) and GPS intelligent buoys (GIB). 

LBL systems (figure ~\ref{fig:standard-lbl}) use a network of two or more sea-floor mounted (anchored) baseline transponders to reference the navigation. Such system is considered to be accurate, generally with accuracy better that 1 meter - usually around few centimetres \cite{noaa01}. However, communication-wise, such system is convenient for small number of vehicles, since one vehicle can query the network each time \cite{bahr08}. Hence, having a large number of vehicles can cause delays in update. Elapsed time between moment of sending the query and receiving the response is used to estimate the time-of-flight ($t_{flight}$) of the wave and eventually the distance ($d$) between beacon and the vehicle, considering that the speed of the sound ($c$) is known and the essential relation $c = \frac{d}{t_{flight}}$ is used for calculation. By using methods such as triangulation, these distances can be used to compute the AUV's absolute position. LBL systems can be long-range or short-range. Long-range systems use 12 kHz frequencies for communication range of 10 km of distance with the error varying from 1 up to 10 m \cite{whitcomb99combined, bahr08}. Short-range systems use 300 kHz frequencies and operate within the range of 100 m with sub-centimetre precision \cite{whitcomb99combined, bahr08}. 
 
SBL systems (figure ~\ref{fig:short-lbl}) do not require sea-floor mounted transponders. Instead SBL system uses a vessel equipped with high-frequency directional emitter in order to accurately determine the AUV position with respect to the vessel \cite{maurelli08}. Disadvantage of such system is the need for providing a vessel and the distance limits since the range between the ship and the AUV has to be short. Moreover, SBL accuracy improves with transducer spacing (possibility of longer baseline). Similarly, the range measurements are used to triangulate the position. Transducer sends a signal, transponder located on the vehicle responds yielding distance information. AUV's location is determined with respect to transducers' location.

USBL systems (figure ~\ref{fig:ultra-short-lbl}) uses similar beacons as LBL system. Difference is that vehicle has transceiver with several receiving elements positioned close to each other on a known distance so that the reply from beacons is detected by all of them. It is possible to calculate the phase difference between received signals this way which is enough to determine the bearing to the beacon. If the distance information is combined together with bearing, then the absolute position of the vehicle can be estimated just by considering the response of only one beacon. 

GIB systems (figure ~\ref{fig:gib-lbl}) consist of floating buoys supplied by GPS signal carrying transducers. Vehicle has a transponder that replies to transducer query with acoustic signal, enabling buoys to register the time-of-flight. Such concept communicates opposite way from the one accomplished in standard LBL.

\end{figure}
Common feature for all the mentioned systems is that the position is inferred from the acoustic feedback of transponders so that the vehicle is capable of locating itself with respect to transponders. Outliers and noise are 

\section{Terrain-aided navigation} \label{sec:terrain-aided}
Terrain-aided navigation can be used to determine the vehicle position using topographic, magnetic or gravitational data \cite{kinsey06}. Terrain-aided navigation can rely on the map of the sea bottom, its elevation or some particular landmarks that are detected to fix the vehicle position. In such circumstances, it is possible to define the map first and try to navigate with respect to that map (map known a-priori) or manage the mapping and navigation simultaneously using sensor data to build the map from the scratch, step by step. Disadvantage of terrain based methods lies in fact that they depend on precision of the map of the floor and ability of the vehicle to sense the depth or image the sea floor. In most of navigation scenarios, a-priori maps are not available \cite{kinsey06}.
The essential sensor for terrain aided navigation is sonar that measures the distance (``time-of-flight''). However it is possible to use the optical sensor devices, for instance cameras, and process the visual information. Range of optical sensors is much shorter, they usually require structured environment, fairly good visibility within the water and the optical information cannot spread as freely and as far as the acoustic information does. However, its nature of information is different, richer with different types of data, including the raw position data. 
\section{SLAM} \label{sec:slam}
Concentrates on establishing essentially autonomous navigation algorithm that would be environment based. Therefore, it is reducing the need for additional infrastructure and using the spatial information from environment to bound the position error. Idea of the concept called SLAM is to localize the robot with respect to environment landmarks \cite{ruiz01}. To accomplish that, two challenging tasks have to be solved: extracting the features and finding a way to measure correspondence between measurement and the feature. Literature offers some solutions to SLAM based approach. Brief overview of some of the methods is given in Section \S~\ref{sec:lit-review}. 
\section{Cooperation for navigation} \label{sec:cooperation}
Advancement in acoustic modems has made it possible to establish more reliable communication and develop communication technologies that engage data from more than one vehicle \cite{bahr08, fallon10}. Idea of involving number of vehicles in exploration is to consider sensor and state information sent from the other vehicles. Advantage of this approach is reduction in amount of sensor equipment, for instance LBL transponders or bathymetry sonars. However, more vehicles need to be deployed. 
\section{Active localisation} \label{sec:active-nav}
Active localisation integrates together control of the robot motion and localisation algorithm. Active refers to vehicle ``activity'', mobility or movement since these strategies sense the environment and combine together localisation with control so that the quality of the localisation is improved. Idea is to guide the motion of the vehicle in order to make it more convenient for the localisation algorithm to work out the tracking \cite{petillot10}.
