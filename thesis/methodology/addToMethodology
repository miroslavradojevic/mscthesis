Working in synchronous mode gives more space for the model to influence the prediction since the period of update can be set and tuned. Asynchronous mode, on the other hand, highly relies on measurements and period between the arrival of sensor measurements - giving less space for tuning. Later tests of Kalman filtering will utilize Kalman working periodically (synchronous mode). Current configuration is set to carry out the prediction in case the scheduled periodical observation was empty. Design has to carefully deal with a scenario where no observations would be made (for instance sensors collapsed). In that case, filter continues to periodically execute predictions - constant speed movement. This feature is valuable in case of temporary missing information, but can cause problems if not limited to certain period since constant speed model has to be aided with measurements. Asynchronous mode updates filter in case there is measurement therefore does not experience such problems. Nevertheless, it is not able to manage predictions in case measurements are not available.
